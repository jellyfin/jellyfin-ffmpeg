ffmpeg (7:2.4-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Cherrypick patches from upstream:
     - fix-build-when-AV_READ_TIME-is-unavailable.patch:
       This fixes building on armel, mipsel and s390x.
     - vf_deshake-rename-Transform.vector-to-Transform.vec.patch:
       This fixes building on powerpc and ppc64el.
     - avcodec-x86-vp9lpf_Always-include-x86util.asm.patch:
       This fixes the executable stack lintian warning for libavcodec on i386.
  * Add lintian overrides for shlib-with-non-pic-code on i386, where non-PIC
    code is allowed.
  * Don't enable opencl, because it is considered experimental.
  * Bump policy to 3.9.6 (no changes required).
  * Mark ffmpeg-doc as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Install the headers in the triplet subdirectory of /usr/include.
    This is necessary, because some headers (e.g. libavutil/avconfig.h)
    are architecture-dependant.

ffmpeg (7:2.4-1) experimental; urgency=medium

     - Fixes CVE-2014-5271: proresenc_ks: fix buffer overflow
     - Fixes CVE-2014-5272: iff: fix out of array access
     - The non-free image tests/lena.pnm is not shipped anymore.
  * Switch Vcs-Browser to the cgit interface.
  * In the development packages add symbolic links from the standard lib*.so
    library names to the suffixed ones.
    This makes it possible to use the normal linker flags, e.g. '-lavcodec',
    to link against the FFmpeg libraries with '-ffmpeg' suffix.
  * Add missing copyright holders/years to debian/copyright.
  * Fix wildcard-matches-nothing-in-dep5-copyright lintian warnings.
  * Add qt-faststart to the Recommends: of the ffmpeg binary package.
  * Configure with --enable-libshine, since libshine >= 3.0.0 is now available
    in Debian.
  * Drop pkg-config_file_without_build_suffix.patch and instead create symlinks
    from the lib*.pc files to the suffixed lib*-ffmpeg.pc files.
  * Install similar symlinks for the static libraries.
  * Don't hardcode default.css as CSS filename in debian/ffmpeg-doc.install.
  * Drop patches included upstream:
     - makeinfo.patch
     - Fix-spelling.patch
  * Update Change-symbol-versioning.patch.
  * Adapt the packaging to the changed library soversions.
  * Generalize ffmpeg.lintian-overrides with wildcards.
  * Add debian/missing-sources with the sources of the minified CSS files in
    the upstream tarball.
  * Create the minified CSS files during package build instead of using the
    ones shipped in the tarball.
    For this add cleancss and node-less to Build-Depends-Indep.
  * Update debian/copyright.

ffmpeg (7:2.3.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Import new upstream release 2.3.1. (Closes: #729203)
     - Fix integer overflow in LZO code. (CVE-2014-4610)
  * Fix FTBFS in Ubuntu caused by the -Bsymbolic-functions linker flag.
    Thanks to Guillaume Martres for pointing out the fix that Fabian Greffrath
    created for the Libav package.
  * Don't ignore test failures anymore, since gcc-4.9 has been fixed to
    compile FFmpeg correctly. (see #746944)
  * Enable libdc1394 only on linux. This fixes FTBFS on !linux-any.
  * Use wildcards instead of multiarch paths and sonames in lintian
    overrides.
  * Fix building on hurd (patch included upstream in 2.2.3).
  * Improve the description of the debug package.
  * Drop fix-tests.patch. Instead export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in debian/rules.
  * Improve the comment in debian/copyright, explaining the effective license
    of the binary packages.
  * Change 'Comments:' to the correct 'Comment:' in debian/copyright.
  * Add some missing files to debian/copyright.
  * Call the upstream Makefile from debian/rules to build the apidoc
    instead of calling the doxy-wrapper directly.
  * Add _FFMPEG to the symbol versions of the libraries to ensure that there
    is no confusion, if a binary is linked against FFmpeg and another shared
    library, which is linked against Libav.
  * Update patches to apply cleanly to 2.3.
  * Add new symbols to the .symbols files.
  * Update lintian overrides.
  * Include config.log in the build-log, when configure fails.
  * Add libgnutls28-dev build-dependency, which was previously pulled in as
    a dependency of another build-dependency.
  * Install the release notes into /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg.
  * Add build-dependencies and enable in debian/rules:
     - libbs2b
     - libfribidi
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Update the dependencies of the *-dev packages.
  * Use packaged libjs-jquery instead of the jquery created by doxygen.
  * Add Fix-spelling patch to fix spelling errors.
  * Mark architecture-dependent symbols as optional.
