Description: Tools for transcoding, streaming and playing of multimedia files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This package contains a static build compatible with all Debian/Ubuntu
 releases, designed to facilitate Jellyfin on systems with a repository ffmpeg
 version of 4.1 or newer, which we do not yet support. Included files are:
  * ffmpeg: a command line tool to convert multimedia files between formats
  * ffplay: a simple media player based on SDL and the FFmpeg libraries
  * ffprobe: a simple multimedia stream analyzer
